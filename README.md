# MNIST-NN

## Downloading dataset
Download the train and test dataset in csv format

## Training steps
1. Load the Training dataset
2. Divide it into "Train" and "Validate" parts
3. Train the neural network with linear layer and activation layer.
4. Run the hyperparameter search grid to find the best hyperparameter.
5. Train the model based on searched parameters.
6. Observe that both training and validation accuracy have increased to over 90%. 

## Testing steps
1. Use the Test dataset to test the model we trained.
2. Obtain accuracy and loss on test dataset.
